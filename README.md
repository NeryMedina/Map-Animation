# Map-Animation

### Description
This repository cotains a visual map that shows all the stops made by a bus between MIT and Harvard University. The marker indicates the location of the bus.

### How to run
In order for this to work you must use and API token and insert in the html and javascript files. Or else it wont work. Once you have inserted and API token you will get the map animation and click on the Show stops between MIT and Harvard located on the top left corner. 

### Roadmap of future improvements
This project will be converted into a real time bus tracker that will track the location of the bus live.
